# multi-processing

The multiprocessing.py file takes 2 arguments at execution time folder1 - that is the folder from which you want to take your files from and folder 2- the folder where you want to paste the files in upper case.

this is just an example for showing how asynchronous multi processing can reduce the time taken to do some work,

for trial a test file is given, a test file maker is also given to make thousands of copy of the given test file change the folder path in the filemaker.py to your desired path, 

at the end of the program a graph will be shown which embarks the time taken for different process counts,

enjoy !!!
